<h1> Parse Tree Graph Generator</h1>
<p>soon there will be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG" >SVG </a> of my symantic parser. This will graph any Context Free grammar in <abbr title="Bacus Naur Form" >BNF</abbr> by converting it to CNF by using the <abbr title="Choker Yomer Kamasai" > CYK </abbr> algorithm. <br><br>If you want hack on this project there are many places to start. You can add languages by adding grammars and lexers for examples. To add a different display method from dot files, you can write a new tree generator from the CKYChart class provided by cyk.py. The dot file generation is in viz.py and is essentially a Bredth first search on the graph/table. CYKChart is a table and remember that graphs and tables are mathmaically the same thing. Look at genTree in viz.py, it generates a tree from the graph, you can generate a different tree in say, xml to create an SVG or a JSON object to pass it to javascript to make a more interactive graph. Remember that you are not limited to LL or LR grammars. You can do any Context Free Grammar.<br><br>Future, plans, I plan to build a interface to TikZ (http://elishapeterson.wikidot.com/tikz:diagrams) or xyling (http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~rvogel/xyling/)<br></p>
